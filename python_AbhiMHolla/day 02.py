# Arithmetic operations

#basic Arithmetic operators part 1

x = 5
y = 3
z=15
print(x + y)
print(z-y)
print(x*y)
print(z/y)
print(z%x)

#comparison operators
    
a = 15
b = 23
print(a == b)  # returns False because 15 is not equal to 23
print(a != b)  # returns True because 15 is not equal to 23
print(a>b)     # returns False because 15 is not greater than 23
print(a<b)     # returns True because 15 is less than to 23
print(a>=b)    # returns False because 15 is not greater than 23
print(a<=b)    # returns True because 15 is less than to 23
