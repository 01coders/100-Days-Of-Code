// The terminal emulator is just the window. It runs a text based program, which by default is your login shell (Ex: bash).

// When you type characters in the window, the terminal draws these characters in the window in addition to sending it to the shellâ€™s stdin.

// The characters the shell outputs to stdout and stderr get sent to the terminal, which in turn draws these characters in the window.
